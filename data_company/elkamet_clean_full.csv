8628137,B2,Profile element connecting a vehicle pane to a water draining chamber,"A profile element for connecting a vehicle pane to a water draining chamber includes a first segment affixable to the vehicle pane. A second segment has, at an upper portion, a bearing rib having at least one seal configured to be disposed at a lower edge of the vehicle pane and, at a lower portion, a snap-in recess configured to receive rib of the water draining chamber through an engagement aperture which is delimited in the insertion direction by a lower-most surface of the bearing rib and an upper-most surface of the resilient leg. A detent element is disposed in the snap-in recess so as to facilitate inserting the rib of the water draining chamber in an insertion direction into the snap-in recess and present a larger resistance to extracting the rib from the snap-in recess in an extraction direction opposite the insertion direction.",2014-01-14,2009-04-30,DE 202008006986 U;;EP 2009003143 W,ELKAMET KUNSTSTOFFTECHNIK (2010-11-15),PLATT WOLFGANG;;ORTMUELLER MICHAEL;;WELLER DANIEL,PLATT WOLFGANG;;ORTMUELLER MICHAEL;;WELLER DANIEL;;ELKAMET KUNSTSTOFFTECHNIK,19,18,29

8444205,B2,Molded component and sealing system for a motor vehicle window,A molded component to connect a motor vehicle window with a water box includes a first segment affixable to the vehicle window and a second segment having a detent cavity bounded by a resilient leg and configured to receive a rib of the water box in an insertion direction so as to detachably affix the water box in a frictionally and/or geometrically interlocking manner in the detent cavity. A detent element projects into the detent cavity at an acute angle relative to the insertion direction such that the resilient leg is elastically deformed to a greater extent during an extraction of the rib of the water box from the detent cavity than during an insertion of the rib of the water box into the detent cavity. This facilitates the insertion and presents a greater resistance to the extraction of the rib from the detent cavity.,2013-05-21,2009-07-23,DE 202008016217 U;;DE 2009001028 W,ELKAMET KUNSTSTOFFTECHNIK GMBH (2011-06-08),FLAMMER EBERHARD;;PLATT WOLFGANG,FLAMMER EBERHARD;;PLATT WOLFGANG;;ELKAMET KUNSTSTOFFTECHNIK GMBH,13,10,17
