The rotational melt mold has at least one of a constriction and a wall that projects, in an area of an inner radius, into an interior of the rotational melt mold. A plastic precursor of the plastic intended for the plastic molded part is provided in the rotational melt mold. The plastic precursor is present as a melt in the rotational melt mold. The rotational melt mold is rotated so that the melt polymerizes and is simultaneously shaped, so that part of the melt is picked up by the insert element, and so that a wall thickness of the molded part in a finished form is increased in an area where the insert element is arranged.",ELKAMET KUNSTSTOFFTECHNIK GMBH,EMRICH MARCO,ELKAMET KUNSTSTOFFTECHNIK GMBH (2015-06-02),https://lens.org/190-357-830-094-280,Granted Patent,yes,9,0,5,5,0,B29C41/06;;B29C41/06;;B29C33/14;;B29C33/14;;B29C41/20;;B29C41/20;;B29K2025/00;;B29K2105/08;;B29K2105/08;;B29K2105/253;;B29K2995/0068;;B29L2031/712;;B29L2031/7172;;B29L2031/7172,B29C41/04;;B29C33/14;;B29C41/06;;B29C41/20;;B29K25/00;;B29K105/00;;B29K105/08;;B29L31/00,,0,0,,,

A detent element projects into the detent cavity at an acute angle relative to the insertion direction such that the resilient leg is elastically deformed to a greater extent during an extraction of the rib of the water box from the detent cavity than during an insertion of the rib of the water box into the detent cavity. This facilitates the insertion and presents a greater resistance to the extraction of the rib from the detent cavity.,FLAMMER EBERHARD;;PLATT WOLFGANG;;ELKAMET KUNSTSTOFFTECHNIK GMBH,FLAMMER EBERHARD;;PLATT WOLFGANG,ELKAMET KUNSTSTOFFTECHNIK GMBH (2011-06-08),https://lens.org/043-882-186-652-522,Granted Patent,yes,13,10,17,17,0,B60J10/70;;B60J10/70;;B60J10/265;;B60J10/265;;B60J10/30;;B60J10/30;;Y10T403/7096;;Y10T403/7096,B60J1/02,296/93;;296/201,1,0,,,"International Search Report for Application No. PCT/DE2009/001028, dated Dec. 14, 2009."
